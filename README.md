# Conway's Game of Life üöÄ  

A multithreaded implementation of **Conway's Game of Life** using **Java** and **JavaFX** for visualization. The game simulates cellular automata, where cells live, die, or multiply based on simple rules, creating fascinating patterns over time.  

---

## Features üß©  
- **Multithreaded Execution:** Each update cycle is efficiently calculated using Java threads to improve performance.  
- **Pixel-Based Visualization:** A smooth, real-time grid-based display powered by JavaFX.  
- **Customizable Grid:** Adjust the grid size, initial states, and simulation speed.  
- **Dynamic Simulation:** The grid updates every second to show the evolution of the game.

## Rules of Conway's Game of Life üå±  
The game follows these simple rules:  
1. **Underpopulation:** Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.  
2. **Overpopulation:** Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.  
3. **Reproduction:** Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.  
4. **Survival:** Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives to the next generation.

## Prerequisites ‚öôÔ∏è  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- **Java JDK 11+**  
- **JavaFX SDK 11+**

## Installation & Running the Project üõ†Ô∏è  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yassirH9/Conway-Game-WithU.git  
   cd Conway-Game-WithU
2. **Add JavaFX Libraries**  
   - Download the [JavaFX SDK](https://openjfx.io/) and set up the `PATH_TO_FX` environment variable.  
   - To set the `PATH_TO_FX`, follow these steps:  
     - On **Windows**:  
       1. Download and extract the JavaFX SDK to a directory of your choice.  
       2. Open System Properties > Environment Variables.  
       3. Add a new variable called `PATH_TO_FX` and set its value to the `lib` folder of your JavaFX SDK directory (e.g., `C:\path\to\javafx-sdk\lib`).  
     - On **Mac/Linux**:  
       1. Download and extract the JavaFX SDK to a directory of your choice.  
       2. Open your terminal and add the following line to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):  
          ```bash  
          export PATH_TO_FX=/path/to/javafx-sdk/lib  
          ```  
       3. Reload your shell configuration:  
          ```bash  
          source ~/.bashrc  
          ```  

3. **Compile and Run**  
   - Use the following commands to compile and run the project:  
     ```bash  
     javac --module-path $PATH_TO_FX --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -d out src/*.java  
     java --module-path $PATH_TO_FX --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp out Main  
     ```
## How to Play üéÆ
- Launch the application.
- A grid will appear representing the initial state of the simulation.
- Watch as the simulation evolves based on Conway's rules.
- Customize parameters in code to change the simulation results.
